Student Data Management System 

Project Overview

Introduction:
The Student Data Management System is a console-based application developed in C++. The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly system for managing student records efficiently. It offers functionalities like entering new data, displaying existing records, updating information, searching for specific records, and deleting data.

Features:

1. Enter Data:
   - Users can input information for multiple students, including ID, name, father's name, roll number, class, and section.
   - Data is stored persistently in a text file for future reference.

2. Display Data:
   - Displays a clear and organized presentation of all student records.
   - Information includes student ID, name, father's name, roll number, class, and section.

3. Update Data:
   - Users can modify existing student records by entering new data.
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for easy updating.

4. Search Data:
   - Enables users to search for specific student records using their unique ID.
   - Displays the details of the searched student.

5. Delete Data:
   - Offers options to either delete the entire record database or delete a specific record based on the student ID.

6. User Authentication:
   - Implements a basic login system with a username and password for data security.

Technology Stack:

- Language: C++
- File Handling: C++ File I/O for persistent data storage
- User Interface: Console-based interface

How to Run:
1. Download the source code files.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable file.
4. Follow on-screen prompts for data management.
   
Future Enhancements:
- Incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Adding additional features like data sorting and statistical analysis.
